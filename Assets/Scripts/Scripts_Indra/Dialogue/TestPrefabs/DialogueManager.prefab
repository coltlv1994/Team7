    - Bring me my food or be my food! Carrots is what I want, though, cake would
      be nice... On with you then! And don't be late...
    - Mmph, very good! Very good! You may have to venture deeper to find more...
      But you'll have to do what it takes! I will be waiting... 'til evening!
    - I could eat these all my days! Making good use of that sword I gave you, eh?
      It is strong enough to whack crates around, an impressive piece of equipment
      if I may say so myself!
    - Oh, finally! Mmm, hits the spot! How are you liking your new life here in the
      dungeon? You better not be looking for a way out...
    - Look who's back! More carrots to me! Mmph, just as good as yesterday.
